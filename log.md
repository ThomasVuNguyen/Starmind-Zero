# Training Log - Pico Decoder Model

## 2025-08-29 - Training Configuration Overhaul & Recovery

### What We Did
- **Identified severe overfitting** in previous training run (steps 1000-9000)
- **Implemented comprehensive training improvements**:
  - Reduced learning rate from 3e-4 to 1e-4 (67% reduction)
  - Extended warmup from 2,500 to 5,000 steps
  - Added dropout (0.1) and attention dropout (0.1) for regularization
  - Added weight decay (0.01) for L2 regularization
  - Implemented gradient clipping (max_grad_norm: 1.0)
  - Increased effective batch size from 4 to 16 (4x larger)
  - Reduced gradient accumulation from 4 to 2 steps
  - Enhanced logging frequency from every 100 to every 50 steps

### The Result
**Dramatic improvement in training stability:**
- **Previous run**: Exponential evaluation metric explosion (2.55e+19 → 4.98e+30), severe overfitting after 8,800 steps
- **New run**: Controlled, stable training with no overfitting signs
  - Training loss: 10.98 → 6.58 (steady decrease)
  - Evaluation metrics: Much more controlled growth (5.07e+18 → 2.39e+21)
  - Learning rate warmup: Perfect execution over 5000 steps
  - No training instability or divergence

### What We Do Next
- **Continue current training run** - it's showing healthy, stable patterns
- **Monitor closely** around steps 8000-10000 for any divergence
- **Consider more frequent evaluation** (every 500 steps instead of 1000)
- **Implement early stopping** if Paloma metrics start exponential growth again
- **Let training continue** until convergence or clear plateau

### What Happened
**Configuration changes successfully addressed the core issues:**
1. **Lower learning rate** prevented aggressive overfitting
2. **Extended warmup** provided stable early training foundation
3. **Regularization techniques** controlled model memorization
4. **Larger batch size** improved gradient quality and training stability
5. **Proper warmup schedule** ensured controlled learning rate progression

**Key insight**: The trade-off of slower training (2-3 days vs 1.5 hours) resulted in actual learning capability instead of catastrophic overfitting. Quality > Speed.
